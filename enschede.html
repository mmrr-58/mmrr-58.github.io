  <h2>Brief</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Enschede Promotie approached
        Creative Technology students with the intention of transforming
        the tourism experience, and aligning its values with its presentation
    </p>
    <p>
        After a meeting with the client, our team of 6 students created
        a proposal for a pervasive game that allowed tourists to explore the 
        city's landmarks in a technology-forward manner.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Our efforts culminated in what we called waypoints, devices that 
        tourists would use to "capture" a landmark, and a general map of
        the area would show what user had claimed which landmarks.

  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        After our initial conversation with the client, we discovered that 
        this project was part of a larger goal of redefining the city as 
        a culturally rich yet innovative and creative environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We conducted an internal storyboarding session where the team
        highlighted what we thought the problem with the current user flow
        was.
    </p>
    <p>
        We discovered that a majority of the team felt friction with
        the flow of discovering a city. Some used social media, or other
        platforms to find activities in foreign cities.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p> 
        The team decided to pursue the creation of a dedicated way of
        interacting with a city through technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After a brainstorming session, we decided on three ideas that
        would be presented to the client. Among them, our final concept:
        A capture-the-flag-style game that used what we would later call
        waypoints. These waypoints would be placed on landmarks, and when
        users approached them, they could use their mobile devices to
        interact "claim" that landmark. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key feature of the waypoint was that the model would
        be scalable. Local businesses would also be marked as 
        waypoints, and allowed tourists to also discover their businesses, 
        immersing them into the culture of the city.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Our first, lo-fi prototype was a set of two pieces. One 
        was a technical implementation of what the waypoint could
        look like. However, as the UX team lead, I prototyped
        the user's flow through the city with a paper prototype. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this first instance, users, depicted as colorful paper
        balls, would traverse a map. Each time they reached a 
        destination, the sign would "light up" in a certain color.
    </p>
    <p>
        This provided the first piece of valuable feedback:
        <span class="bold">Users appreciate the feeling of
        reward. </span>
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        After the success of Prototype 1, the team iterated based on user's
        and client's feedback, and we created a higher fidelity version 
        of the project. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This version was now a fully distributed system, capable of 
        logging different users with their selected colors
    </p>
    <p>
        My responsibility during this period was to conduct user tests
        and interviews to determine what needed further refinement
        before the demo that we would present to our client.
