  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div class="content"> 
    <p>
      Playful intelligence was a speculative design project focused on building a voice 
      agent for children. The goal was to extract current trends, extend them to the near future, 
      and create an interface for a product that could exist in the prospective world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this 2-month long university project, <span class="bold">I worked as an interaction designer and a hardware 
        engineer</span>. I was responsible for conceptualizing the interaction model and user experience, while also 
        building the physical prototype including electronics integration and LED feedback system.  
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
    We began by considering a current negative behavior the team sees in children, and convert it 
    into something positive. For this challenge, we looked at the current overconsumption and 
    over-dependence that children experience with technology. Specifically, how technology learned 
    to target children, and how it affects a child's development. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The team compared this to our own experience growing up, where access to technology was 
      limited. Instead, our development was the cause of not only influences from real life, but 
      the stories we heard and saw when we were younger. Experiencing imagination was a deeply 
      formative experience, because it was meant to fill in the gaps in a story with our own 
      thoughts and emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ideation lead us to conceptualizing how artificial intelligence can be a servant of 
      imagination, creating with a person rather than for a person.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Co-Creation Workshop</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      While the team's intuitive approach to the problem seemed reasonable, we wanted to validate 
      our design brief by hosting a workshop alongside stakeholders. A big focal point of the 
      project was Participatory Design, and how to ground concepts in functionality. Beyond 
      understanding what the form factor should be, the workshop was an opportunity to learn how 
      children currently interact with AI, and why it might need change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">I facilitated a co-creation workshop</span> with 4 stakeholders with the 
      following plan:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A brief icebreaker, where we asked participants to share a story about their favorite toy as children</p></li>
      <li><p>A storyboard session centered around capturing noticed child behaviors with technology and their concerns as stakeholders</p></li>
      <li><p>A role-play scenario, where stakeholders played a child and a voice agent</p></li>
      <li><p>An Insights wrap-up, which provided notes with actionable data for further refinement of ideas.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The outcomes of this workshop were that stakeholders acknowledged the increasingly concerning
      issues regarding current tech standards for children. One stakeholder commented: "Children 
      are spectators. They experience life as a process done to them." They further reflected that 
      interaction with the world has migrated to a digital environment, making it isolating. 
    </p>
    <p>
      During the role-play, the group found that their interaction with an "artificial intelligence" 
      were lead primarily by curiosity, pretending to want to learn about the world around them. 
      After role playing, stakeholders found themselves advocating for AI to be a complement to 
      children development and, while expressing hesitancy, they said that it could be a valuable 
      tool for education and nurture. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapping up, <span class="bold">the group laid down the foundations for the project</span>. They wanted something 
      that protected children's curiosity, creativity, and autonomy. Relating to their previous 
      experiences during the role-play, they expressed the desire for a voice agent that only 
      works while children are actively engaging it.
    </p>

  <h2>Prototype</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The first iteration in the project was a box that would sit on a table and would narrate 
      stories when it was open. <span class="bold">As an interaction designer, I focused on</span> how the child 
      should interpret a system, and how to protect their autonomy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When building the physical prototype, we opted to use LEDs in box to give system status. 
      When it was listening, the box would pulse gently, informing the user that it was expecting 
      input. When it was narrating a story, it was a solid color. Finally, a top cover was fitted 
      on the box, so that when opened it would spring to life, and remain asleep if it was closed.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      After a round of feedback, we were made aware that there was a product currently on the 
      market that was nearly identical to ours, without voice interaction capabilities. Other 
      feedback expressed confusion with the process of interacting with the prototype. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The feedback ultimately meant that we would have to come up with a different approach. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Final Version</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      There was some good that came out of the feedback session. One tester said that they 
      would have liked a material way of interacting with the project. With this in mind, 
      <span class="bold">we redesigned the concept</span> to also addressed the physicality of our project. 
      We took inspiration from figurines and dolls, and created a concept that was based on 
      characters, instead of a central narrator.
    </p>
    <img src="resources/Pictures_PlayfulIntelligence/saltAndPepperRendered.png" alt="">
    <p>
      We kept the boxy form factor, because we found that it was easier to map characters 
      onto an object if the object was very minimal. A box could be a knight, an astronaut, 
      or a dog. But now, the boxes could be picked up and played with physically. We also kept 
      the LEDs as the primary indicator, but now, when they talked, the LEDs could light up 
      independently, making the interaction between characters richer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">The final prototype featured</span> two 3D printed boxes 
      <span class="note">unofficially called Salt and Pepper</span>, and the base on which 
      they would sit. There was lights inside of the base, so that it would look like a night 
      light, and when the boxes would be picked up, they would light up. For the noisy 
      environment of the presentation room, we opted to use bluetooth headphones from which 
      the user would talk to the machine running a small AI model fine-tuned to make stories 
      with 2 characters and user input.

  <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This project taught me valuable lessons in speculative and participatory design, 
      especially in facilitating co-creation workshops and translating stakeholder insights 
      into design requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the technical side, I gained hands-on experience with hardware prototyping, learning 
      the fundamentals of battery chemistry, wireless communication protocols, and integrating 
      AI models with physical interfaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">What I'd do differently</span>: Looking back, I would focus more on creating a 
      realistic, implementable product. I felt really connected to this project, and would 
      love to continue it's development. Had I given certain details more thought, I think it 
      could have been a potentially viable product concept.
