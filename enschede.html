  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Enschede Promotie approached
        Creative Technology students with the intention of transforming
        the tourism experience, and aligning its values with its presentation
    </p>
    <p>
        After a meeting with the client, our team of 6 students created
        a proposal for a pervasive game that allowed tourists to explore the 
        city's landmarks in a technology-forward manner.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Our efforts culminated in what we called waypoints, devices that 
        tourists would use to "capture" a landmark, and a general map of
        the area would show what user had claimed which landmarks.

  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        After our initial conversation with the client, we discovered that 
        this project was part of a larger goal of redefining the city as 
        a culturally rich yet innovative and creative environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We conducted an internal storyboarding session where the team
        highlighted what we thought the problem with the current user flow
        was.
    </p>
    <p>
        We discovered that a majority of the team felt friction with
        the flow of discovering a city. Most used social media, or other
        platforms to find activities in foreign cities.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p> 
        The team decided to pursue the creation of a dedicated way of
        interacting with a city through technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After a brainstorming session, we decided on three ideas that
        would be presented to the client. Among them, our final concept:
        A capture-the-flag-style game that used what we would later call
        waypoints. These waypoints would be placed on landmarks, and when
        users approached them, they could use their mobile devices to
        interact "claim" that landmark. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key feature of the waypoint was that the model would
        be scalable. Local businesses would also be marked as 
        waypoints, and allowed tourists to also discover their businesses, 
        immersing them into the culture of the city.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Our first, lo-fi prototype was a set of two pieces. One 
        was a technical implementation of what the waypoint could
        look like. However, as the UX team lead, I prototyped
        the user's flow through the city with a paper prototype. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this first instance, users, depicted as colorful paper
        balls, would traverse a map. Each time they reached a 
        destination, the sign would "light up" in a certain color.
    </p>
    <p>
        This provided the first piece of valuable feedback:
        <span class="bold">Users appreciate the feeling of
        reward. </span>
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
  <div class="content">
        <div class="gallery">
        <img src="resources/Pictures_Tourism/waypoint2.jpeg" alt="Image of the waypoints being used" class="galleryImage">
        <img src="resources/Pictures_Tourism/projection.jpeg" alt="Image of the projection used as an overview of user progress" class="galleryImage">
    </div>
    <p>
        After the success of Prototype 1, the team iterated based on user's
        and client's feedback, and we created a higher fidelity version 
        of the project. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This version was now a fully distributed system, capable of 
        logging different users with their selected colors
    </p>
    <p>
        To address user feedback from the first prototype, proper goal definition
        became a priority for the team. In our second iteration, we tested an
        area capture display, which showed in real time the waypoint's color
        so that users felt a sense of competition and reward for capturing
        chunks of a map. 

    </p>
    <p>
        My responsibility during this period was to conduct user tests
        and interviews to determine what needed further refinement
        before the final demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
        These user tests demonstrated that our iterative work had translated
        the first prototype into a fully functional system. Users reported 
        that the prototype felt easy to use, with the average completion time
        or a trial being just under 10 minutes, compared to the benchmark set 
        by a team member of 8:30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our post-use-evaluation interviews, we found that users created their 
        own rules. One tester attempted to collect as many waypoints as possible in 
        the shortest amount of time, Others enjoyed the exploratory aspects of the
        game. The game had become accessible and friendlier to any kind of playstyle.
        It provided the second valuable insight of the project: <span class="bold">
        Implicit game mechanics means you can make your own rules</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users also reported that our second iteration felt much more rewarding. By
        adding the overview, they felt a sense of progression and desire to 
        continue playing.
