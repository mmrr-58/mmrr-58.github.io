  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Enschede Promotie approached
        Creative Technology students with the intention of transforming
        the tourism experience, and aligning its values with its presentation
    </p>
    <p>
        After a meeting with the client, <span class="bold">our team of 6 students created
        a IoT game </span> that allowed tourists to explore the 
        city's landmarks in a technology-forward way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">During this project, I was responsible for</span> user experience design 
        and user testing. I also facilitated internal brainstorming and storboarding sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our efforts culminated in what we called waypoints, devices that 
        tourists would use to "capture" a landmark, and a general map of
        the area would show what user had claimed which landmarks.

  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        After our initial conversation with the client, we discovered that 
        this project was part of a larger goal to redefine Enschede as 
        a culturally rich yet innovative and creative environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We conducted an internal storyboarding session where the team
        highlighted what we thought the problem with the current experience
        was.
    </p>
    <p>
        We discovered that a majority of the team felt friction with
        the flow of discovering a city. Most used social media or other
        platforms to find activities in foreign cities.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p> 
        The team decided to pursue the creation of a dedicated way of
        interacting with a city through technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After a brainstorming session, we decided on three ideas that
        would be presented to the client. Among them, our final concept:
        A capture-the-flag-style game that used what we would later call
        waypoints. These waypoints would be placed on landmarks, and when
        users approached them, they could use their mobile devices to
        interact "claim" that landmark. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key feature of the waypoint was that the model would
        be scalable. Local businesses would also be marked as 
        waypoints, and allowed tourists to also discover their businesses, 
        immersing them into the culture of the city.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        Our first, lo-fi prototype was a set of two pieces. One 
        was a technical implementation of what the waypoint could
        look like. <span class="bold">I created the second piece of the concept</span>, 
        a simulated experience made of paper
    </p>
    <p>
        In this first instance, testers, depicted as colorful paper
        balls, would traverse a map. Each time they reached a 
        destination, the sign would "light up" in a certain color.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this the early stages, <span class="bold"> I made note of users 
        feedback and emotional states</span> throughout the pretend experience. 
        which informed the team's design decisions. Specifically, some users 
        reported lack of motivation to finish the experience, while others 
        enjoyed the distributed nature of the game.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
  <div class="content">
        <div class="gallery">
        <img src="resources/Pictures_Tourism/waypoint2.jpeg" alt="Image of the waypoints being used" class="galleryImage">
        <img src="resources/Pictures_Tourism/projection.jpeg" alt="Image of the projection used as an overview of user progress" class="galleryImage">
    </div>
    <p>
        After the success of Prototype 1, the team iterated based on user's
        and client's feedback, and we created a higher fidelity version 
        of the project. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This version was now a fully distributed system, capable of 
        logging different users with their selected colors
    </p>
    <p>
        To address user feedback from the first prototype, proper goal definition
        became a priority for the team. In our second iteration, we tested an
        area capture display, which showed in real time the waypoint's color
        so that users felt a sense of competition and reward for capturing
        chunks of a map. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">My responsibility during this period was</span> 
        to conduct user tests and interviews to determine what needed further 
        refinement before the final demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
        These user tests demonstrated that our iterative work had translated
        the first prototype into a fully functional system. <span class="bold">Users reported 
        that the prototype felt easy to use</span>, with the average completion time
        or a trial being just under 10 minutes, compared to the benchmark set 
        by a team member of 8:30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our post-use-evaluation interviews, we found that users created their 
        own rules. One tester attempted to collect as many waypoints as possible in 
        the shortest amount of time, Others enjoyed the exploratory aspects of the
        game. The game had become accessible and friendlier to any kind of playstyle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users also reported that our second iteration felt much more rewarding. By
        adding the overview, they felt a sense of progression and desire to 
        continue playing.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Final Concept</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <img src="resources/Pictures_Tourism/unnamed.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
       The final concept was demonstrated at a demo market, where we 
        showcased the complete waypoint system to Enschede Promotie and 
        other stakeholders. The demonstration validated our approach: 
        <span class="bold">visitors engaged naturally with the game</span>, 
        exploring the space while competing to claim waypoints.
    </p>
    <p>
        The waypoint concept achieved its goal of creating a 
        technology-forward tourism experience that aligned with Enschede's 
        values of innovation and cultural richness, while providing an 
        engaging, scalable platform for visitors to discover the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the successful demonstration, <span class="bold">we handed 
        off the project to Enschede Promotie</span> for implementation in and 
        around the city.
    </p>

  <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        This project marked an important milestone in developing my research 
        skills. While I had theoretical knowledge of user testing and interview
        methodologies, <span class="bold">this was my first opportunity to apply
        these practices</span>. Looking back, I recognize moments where more
        refined approaches would have yielded deeper insights
    </p>
    <p>
        These early experiences with research and observation shaped how
        continuously refine my research in future projects. I think about 
        UX practices. They instilled in me the commitment to
