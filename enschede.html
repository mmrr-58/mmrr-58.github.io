        Enschede Promotie approached
        Creative Technology students with the intention of transforming
        the tourism experience, and align its values with its presentation
    </p>
    <p>
        After a meeting with the client, in a team of 6 students, we created
        a proposal for a pervasive game that allowed tourists to explore the 
        city's landmarks in a techonlogy forward manner.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Our efforts culminated in what we called waypoints, devices that 
        tourists would use to "capture" a landmark, and a general map of
        the area would show what user had claimed whhich landmark

    <p class="bold">Problem Definition</p>
    <p>
        After our initial conversation with the client, we discovered that 
        this project was part of a larger goal of redefining the city as 
        a culturally rich yet innovative and creative environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We counducted an internal story boarding session where the team
        highlighted what we thought the problem with the current user flow
        was.
    </p>
    <p>
        We discovered that a majority of the team felt friction with
        the flow of discovering a city. Some used social media, or other
        platforms to find activities in foreign cities.

    <p class="bold">Ideation</p>
    <p> 
        The team decided to pursue the creation of a dedicated way of
        interacting with a city through technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After a brainstorming session, we decided on three ideas that
        would be presented to the client. Among them, our final concept:
        A capture-the-flag-style game that used what we would later call
        waypoints. These waypoints would be placed on landmarks, and when
        users approached them, they could use their mobile devices to
        interact "claim" that landmark. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another key feature of the waypoint was that the model would
        be scalable. Local businesses would also be marked as 
        waypoints, and allowed tourists to discover more than 
        landmarks, immersing them into the culture of the city.
