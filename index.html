    <p>Philosophy</p>
    <p>I value working between the lines of technical challenges and joyful solutions. My aim is to create functional and memorable user experiences.</p>
    <p class="note">Note: Now I should explain what that means</p>
    <p>
      Emotions have their own gravity. They pull me toward the moments that become our most lived-in memories. 
      Born as simple evolutionary tools to detect <span class="strikeOut">juicy, ripe fruit</span> danger, 
      they've evolved into the very medium through which we experience the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creation allows a person to tap into emotionally charged experiences. Through iteration and solution, it becomes possible to harness and
      optimize for whimsical, horrific, or <a href="">sublime</a> experiences
